# Equalizer-Galaxy
A WebGL experiment based on Three.js, some Shaders and the web audio API. I play with vertices from Buffer Geometry to make Points Objects as Particle System. The colors react to the average of the sound frequency.

Demo available on the crma promotion of 2016 website (Gobelins school at Paris) [here](http://workshop.crma2016.gobelins.fr/).

#### Technologies :
* ThreeJs
