# Equalizer-Galaxy
A WebGL experiment based on Three.js, some Shaders and the web audio API. I play with vertices from Buffer Geometry to make Points Objects as Particle System. The colors react to the average of the sound frequency.

Demo available [here](http://www.mathis-biabiany.fr/webgl/equalizer/).

#### Technologies :
* ThreeJs
* GLSL
* Web Audio Api

#### Setup from the [boilerplate](https://github.com/vdaguenet/threejs-starter-kit) of [vdaguenet](https://github.com/vdaguenet)  :
After cloning install all node dependencies and libraries :  
```shell
npm i
npm start
```

#### If you want to deploy  :
```shell
npm run build
```

Enjoy !
